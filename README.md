**Latest release**: [v2.2.3 Release Notes](docs/RELEASES/v2.2.3/release_notes.md) | [All releases](https://github.com/t-ogura/zmk-config-prospector/releases)

### What's New in v2.2.3 (scanner stability release)

**Scanner firmware update strongly recommended.** A deep review of the scanner
found several long-standing causes of the "display frozen after hours of use"
class of bugs, all fixed here:

- **Stack corruption fixed**: a struct defined in two files drifted apart in
  v2.2.0, so a 10Hz bulk copy overwrote ~8 bytes of the display thread's stack
- **LVGL render stall fixed**: the layer-change pulse animation used a scale
  transform whose per-frame 4-7KB buffer could fail once the LVGL pool
  fragmented, leaving the renderer spinning forever; it now pulses opacity
  in place (and the pool grew 32KB → 48KB)
- **Stale selection fixed**: after every keyboard timed out, a returning
  keyboard could land in a different slot and never be re-selected — the
  display stayed on "Scanning..." forever
- **Thread-safety pass**: display-thread readers now lock against the
  processing workqueue; pointer-based keyboard access replaced with
  copy-under-lock snapshots
- **Crash recovery + watchdog (new)**: fatal errors and hung threads now
  record their cause and reboot the scanner instead of freezing it; the boot
  log reports "Recovered from crash: ..." for diagnosis
- **Auto-brightness fix**: the ambient light sensor poll now starts on boot
  when the persisted setting is "auto" (previously it silently did nothing
  until the switch was toggled)

**New (keyboard-side, optional)**: `CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_CENTRAL_SIDE="AUX"`
for split keyboards whose central is neither half (e.g. a trackball unit):
both halves map to the left/right battery slots and the central's own battery
shows in the Aux1 slot. Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_EXPECTED_PERIPHERAL_COUNT=2`
in that topology.

**Internal**: the keyboard-tracking core moved from the shield into the shared
module (`src/scanner_core.c`) in preparation for the upcoming Scanner Pocket
device. Wire protocol unchanged — all v2.2.x keyboards and scanners interop.

### What's New in v2.2.2 (patch from v2.2.1)

**Fixes** (keyboard-side module only, scanner unchanged):
- Uni-body keyboards build again — v2.2.1 failed with `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SPLIT_PARTIAL_BURST_MS undeclared` ([issue #24](https://github.com/t-ogura/zmk-config-prospector/issues/24))
- Split centrals no longer get the burst/silent adv cycle stuck on forever when the peripheral connects before the module initialises — the keyboard now shows up on the scanner continuously instead of flickering in ~10% of the time ([issue #22](https://github.com/t-ogura/zmk-config-prospector/issues/22))

No new config options. Bump the module `revision` to `v2.2.2`, `west update`, rebuild, flash.

### What's New in v2.2.1 (patch from v2.2.0)

**Fix**: Cold-boot peripheral connection failures on multi-peripheral split keyboards. Status advertisement no longer steals radio time from ZMK split scan/connect during peripheral discovery (see [issue #20](https://github.com/t-ogura/zmk-config-prospector/issues/20)).

**Multi-peripheral builds** (e.g. central + right half + trackball): set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_EXPECTED_PERIPHERAL_COUNT=2` (or higher) in your keyboard config so the burst/silent cycle stays engaged until all peripherals are up. Default is 1 (typical 2-half split). Standalone keyboards are unaffected.

### What's New in v2.2.0 (from v2.1.0)

**New Features**:
- 3 new display layouts: Operator, Radii, Field (inspired by [carrefinho](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector-zmk-module))
- NVS settings persistence (channel, brightness, layout survive reboot)
- Version protocol: keyboard firmware version displayed on scanner Quick Actions screen
- Boot burst for immediate scanner detection on keyboard startup
- High-priority change detection: layer/modifier/profile changes update instantly, WPM/battery at 1Hz
- `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` for non-touch startup layout selection
- 3-battery bar display (Operator layout auto-switches from arc when 3+ peripherals)

**Stability & BLE**:
- Scanner freeze fix: mutex + work handler architecture with lock-free BT RX ring buffer
- 3-mode Hybrid ADV: Piggyback / Non-connectable / Connectable Proxy
- Burst on layer, modifier, and profile changes (5×15ms) for reliable delivery
- Activity-based intervals: 1Hz when typing, configurable idle interval

**Compatibility**:
- Keyboard firmware: ZMK main (Zephyr 4.x) and ZMK 0.3 (Zephyr 3.5) both supported
- Scanner firmware: ZMK main required
- GitHub Actions: updated for ZMK board variant (`xiao_ble/nrf52840/zmk`)

**Keyboard-side `west.yml`**:
```yaml
- name: prospector-zmk-module
  remote: prospector
  revision: v2.2.3
  path: modules/prospector-zmk-module
```

## What is Prospector Scanner?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/scanner.jpg" alt="Prospector Scanner in action" width="600">
</p>

**Prospector Scanner** is an independent BLE status display device for ZMK keyboards. It monitors your keyboard's status (battery, layer, modifiers, WPM, etc.) in real-time without consuming a BLE connection slot.

### About Prospector

**Prospector** is a community hardware platform originally created by [carrefinho](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector) as a universal ZMK keyboard dongle (keyboard → dongle → PC connection). This project takes the same hardware platform but uses it in a completely different way:

**Original Prospector (Dongle Mode)**:
- Keyboard connects to Prospector via BLE
- Prospector connects to PC via USB or BLE
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: Keyboard can only connect to dongle (loses multi-device capability)
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: Requires keyboard-specific dongle shield configuration
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: PC can't connect to keyboard directly

**This Project (Scanner Mode)**:
- Keyboard broadcasts status via BLE Advertisement (observer mode)
- Prospector only **listens** - does NOT connect to keyboard
- ✅ **Advantage**: Keyboard maintains full 5-device connectivity
- ✅ **Advantage**: Works with ANY ZMK keyboard (no shield needed)
- ✅ **Advantage**: Keyboard can connect directly to PC/tablet/phone

### Why Scanner Mode?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/why_scanner.png" alt="Dongle Mode vs Scanner Mode" width="700">
</p>

**Key Benefit**: Your keyboard stays fully functional with all devices while Scanner provides visual monitoring.

### Hardware Platform

Both modes use the same hardware:
- **MCU**: Seeeduino XIAO BLE (nRF52840)
- **Display**: Waveshare 1.69" Round LCD with touch panel (ST7789V + CST816S)
- **3D Case**: Open-source design from original Prospector

**Important**: Even "non-touch mode" uses the touch-enabled LCD - we simply don't wire the 4 touch pins. Original Prospector uses the same display but doesn't utilize touch functionality.

## Touch Mode vs Non-Touch Mode

v2.0 supports **two build configurations**: Touch Mode and Non-Touch Mode.

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | Non-Touch Mode | Touch Mode |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Display** | Waveshare 1.69" Touch LCD | Same display |
| **Wiring** | 6 display pins + power (touch pins **not connected**) | **+4 touch pins** (TP_SDA/SCL/INT/RST) |
| **Settings** | Kconfig only (rebuild to change) | Interactive on-device adjustment |
| **Gestures** | Not supported | 4-direction swipe gestures |
| **Firmware Size** | ~900KB | ~920KB (+20KB) |
| **Configuration** | Edit `prospector_scanner.conf` | Edit `prospector_scanner.conf` + enable touch |

**Note**: Both modes use the **same Waveshare 1.69" Touch LCD** hardware. Non-touch mode simply leaves the 4 touch pins unconnected (same as original Prospector).

### Which Mode Should I Choose?

#### Choose **Non-Touch Mode** if:
- ✅ You want simpler wiring (6 display pins only, no touch pins)
- ✅ You don't need on-device settings adjustment
- ✅ You want maximum firmware simplicity
- ✅ You're following original Prospector hardware setup

#### Choose **Touch Mode** if:
- ✅ You want to wire the 4 touch pins for interactive control
- ✅ You want to adjust settings without rebuilding firmware
- ✅ You want swipe gestures for future features
- ✅ You're comfortable with +4 pin wiring

### Touch Mode Details

👉 **[Complete Touch Mode Guide →](docs/TOUCH_MODE.md)**

Touch mode requires:
- Same Waveshare 1.69" Round LCD (with CST816S touch controller)
- **4 additional connections**: TP_SDA, TP_SCL, TP_INT, TP_RST
- Configuration change: Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=y` in `prospector_scanner.conf`

**This guide focuses on Non-Touch Mode** (standard Prospector wiring). For touch-specific setup, see the touch mode guide.

   - Press RESET button **twice quickly** (within 0.5 seconds)
   - `XIAO-SENSE` drive appears

2. **Flash firmware**:
   - Drag `.uf2` file to `XIAO-SENSE` drive
   - Drive disconnects automatically
   - Scanner reboots

### Step 4: Configure Keyboard

#### 4a. Add module to your keyboard's `config/west.yml`:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: prospector
      url-base: https://github.com/t-ogura

  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml

    # Add this:
    - name: prospector-zmk-module
      remote: prospector
      revision: v2.2.2
      path: modules/prospector-zmk-module
```

#### 4b. Add to your keyboard's `.conf` file:

```conf
# Enable status advertisement
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADVERTISEMENT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_KEYBOARD_NAME="MyKeyboard"

# Split keyboard only: enable peripheral battery fetching
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_FETCHING=y
```

#### 4c. Rebuild and flash:

```bash
west update
west build -b your_board -- -DSHIELD=your_shield
# Copy .uf2 to bootloader drive
```

### Step 5: Test

1. Power on scanner (should show "Waiting for keyboards...")
2. Power on keyboard
3. Scanner should detect keyboard within a few seconds
4. Check display shows: device name, layer, battery, etc.

**Success!** Your scanner is working.

### Wiring Tips

1. **Test Display First**: Wire display pins and verify basic operation before adding sensor
2. **Keep Wires Short**: I2C works best with wires < 10cm
3. **Built-in Pull-ups**: XIAO BLE has I2C pull-ups on D4/D5 - no external resistors needed
4. **Polarity Check**: Double-check VCC/GND before powering on
5. **Clean Solder**: Poor solder joints cause intermittent display issues

## Configuration Guide

Configuration file: `config/prospector_scanner.conf`

### Essential Settings

#### Scanner Mode (Required)

```conf
# Enable scanner mode
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MODE_SCANNER=y

# Multi-keyboard support (enabled by default)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MULTI_KEYBOARD=y
```

#### Display & LVGL

```conf
# Display subsystem
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY=y
CONFIG_DISPLAY=y
CONFIG_LVGL=y

# Required LVGL widgets
CONFIG_LV_USE_BTN=y
CONFIG_LV_USE_SLIDER=y
CONFIG_LV_USE_SWITCH=y

# Fonts (already configured in default prospector_scanner.conf)
# CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_12=y
# CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_16=y
# ... etc
```

**Note**: Font settings are pre-configured in `prospector_scanner.conf`. No manual font configuration needed.

### Layer Display Configuration

```conf
# Number of layer indicators shown on screen
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MAX_LAYERS=7        # Range: 4-10

# Visual effect:
# - 4 layers: Wide spacing, large indicators
# - 7 layers: Medium spacing (default)
# - 10 layers: Tight spacing, maximum capacity
```

**Match your keyboard**: Set this to match your keyboard's layer count for best appearance. If your keyboard has 5 layers, set to 5 for optimal spacing.

### Layer Slide Mode (v2.1 New)

```conf
# Enable dial-style animated layer display
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_LAYER_SLIDE_DEFAULT=y
```

**What it does**: Active layer slides to center position with smooth animation. Layer changes animate based on direction (increase = slide from right, decrease = slide from left).

**Over-max behavior**: When layer exceeds `MAX_LAYERS`, displays a single large number instead of the layer list.

**Touch mode**: Can be toggled on-device. See **[Touch Mode Guide](docs/TOUCH_MODE.md)** for details.

### Channel Feature (v1.1.2+)

Channels allow filtering specific keyboards in multi-keyboard environments.

#### Keyboard Side (your keyboard's .conf)

```conf
# Channel broadcasting (add to your keyboard config)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_CHANNEL=0    # 0 = broadcast to all scanners (default)
                                # 1-9 = specific channel (recommended)
                                # 10-255 = also supported but not selectable in touch UI
```

#### Scanner Side (config/prospector_scanner.conf)

**Touch mode**: Channel can be changed dynamically on-device. See **[Touch Mode Guide](docs/TOUCH_MODE.md)**.

**Non-touch mode**: Set channel via Kconfig:
```conf
# Channel filter for scanner (non-touch mode)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SCANNER_CHANNEL=0   # 0 = receive all (default)
                                       # 1-9 = specific channel (recommended)
```

**Recommended range**: Use channels 0-9 for compatibility with touch mode UI.

**Use case examples**:
- **Home/Office separation**: Home keyboards on channel 1, office on channel 2
- **Multi-user**: Each user's keyboards on different channels
- **Testing**: Isolate test keyboards from production display

**Compatibility**: Keyboard side works with v2.0.0+. Scanner side channel filter requires v2.1.0+ for touch mode dynamic switching.

### Peripheral Battery Slot Mapping (v2.1 New)

For split keyboards with multiple peripherals (e.g., keyboard half + trackball), you can remap which peripheral appears in which display slot.

```conf
# Add to your keyboard's .conf file
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_HALF_PERIPHERAL=0   # Keyboard half slot (default: 0)
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_AUX1_PERIPHERAL=1   # Aux1 slot, e.g., trackball (default: 1)
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_AUX2_PERIPHERAL=2   # Aux2 slot, e.g., numpad (default: 2)
```

**When to use**: After `settings_reset`, peripherals may reconnect in different order than expected. Use these settings to fix the display order without re-pairing.

**Example**: If your trackball (should be Aux1) connected before keyboard half:
```conf
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_HALF_PERIPHERAL=1   # Keyboard half is now index 1
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_AUX1_PERIPHERAL=0   # Trackball is now index 0
```

### Brightness Control

#### Fixed Brightness (Simple)

```conf
# Disable ambient light sensor
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=n

# Set fixed brightness (0-100%)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_FIXED_BRIGHTNESS=85
```

Best for: Users without APDS9960 sensor, or who prefer manual control.

#### Automatic Brightness (Advanced)

```conf
# Enable ambient light sensor (requires APDS9960 hardware)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=y

# Brightness range
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ALS_MIN_BRIGHTNESS=20       # Minimum (dark rooms)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ALS_MAX_BRIGHTNESS_USB=100  # Maximum (USB power)

# Smooth fade transitions
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BRIGHTNESS_FADE_DURATION_MS=800  # 800ms fade
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BRIGHTNESS_FADE_STEPS=12         # 12 steps
```

**What happens**: Scanner reads ambient light every few seconds and smoothly adjusts brightness (20-100%) with 800ms fade. No jarring changes.

**Hardware requirement**: APDS9960 sensor wired to D4/D5 (4-pin connection, no interrupt pin needed).

### Timeout Brightness (v2.0 New)

```conf
# Auto-dim when no keyboard activity
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SCANNER_TIMEOUT_MS=480000      # 8 minutes (0=disabled)
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SCANNER_TIMEOUT_BRIGHTNESS=5   # Dim to 5%
```

**What it does**:
1. If no keyboard data received for 8 minutes → dim to 5%
2. When keyboard sends data again → restore previous brightness
3. Works with both USB and battery power

**Use case**: Battery-powered scanner - extends battery life when keyboards are turned off.

**Disable**: Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SCANNER_TIMEOUT_MS=0` to disable timeout.

### Scanner Battery Support

```conf
# Enable scanner's own battery monitoring
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BATTERY_SUPPORT=y   # Requires LiPo connected to XIAO BLE
CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORTING=y        # ZMK battery subsystem
```

**What you see**: Battery icon (🔋) in top-right corner with percentage and charging indicator.

**Hardware requirement**: LiPo battery connected to XIAO BLE's BAT+/BAT- pads.

**No battery?** Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BATTERY_SUPPORT=n` - no battery widget shown.

### USB Logging (Development)

```conf
# Enable USB serial logging
CONFIG_LOG=y
CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y

# Reduce BT noise
CONFIG_BT_LOG_LEVEL_WRN=y
CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=4
```

**How to use**:
1. Enable these settings
2. Rebuild firmware
3. Connect via USB
4. Open serial monitor (e.g., `screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200`)
5. See debug logs for troubleshooting

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Design

**Scanner Mode Design** (Independent Monitoring):
- Keyboard → Multiple Devices (up to 5 via normal BLE connections)
- Keyboard → Scanner (BLE Advertisement broadcast only - no connection)
- Scanner operates independently without consuming connection slots

### System Components

```
┌─────────────┐    BLE Adv     ┌──────────────┐
│   Keyboard  │ ──────────────→│   Scanner    │
│             │    26-byte     │   Display    │
│ (1Hz/idle)  │    Protocol    │  (USB/Battery)│
└─────────────┘                └──────────────┘
       │
       ├── Device 1 (PC)
       ├── Device 2 (Tablet)
       ├── Device 3 (Phone)
       ├── Device 4 (...)
       └── Device 5 (...)
```

**Key Points**:
- Keyboard broadcasts status via BLE Advertisement (observer mode)
- Scanner only **listens** - does NOT connect to keyboard
- Keyboard maintains full 5-device connectivity
- Scanner can be powered via USB or battery (optional)

### Communication Flow

                                       └─→ Display to screen
                                           (YADS-style UI)
```

## 📊 Protocol Specification

### BLE Advertisement Format (26 bytes)

The keyboard broadcasts its status using a custom BLE Advertisement payload. Scanner receives this in observer mode (no connection needed).

| Offset | Field | Size | Description | Example |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 0-1 | Manufacturer ID | 2 bytes | `0xFF 0xFF` (Custom/Local use) | `FF FF` |
| 2-3 | Service UUID | 2 bytes | `0xAB 0xCD` (Prospector Protocol ID) | `AB CD` |
| 4 | Version | 1 byte | `[7:4]`=module major, `[3:0]`=module minor | `22` (v2.2) |
| 5 | Battery Level | 1 byte | Main battery 0-100% (Central for split) | `5A` (90%) |
| 6 | Active Layer | 1 byte | Current layer 0-15 | `02` (Layer 2) |
| 7 | Profile Slot | 1 byte | `[6]`=dev flag, `[5:3]`=patch, `[2:0]`=profile 0-4 | `01` (Profile 1, v*.*.0 release) |
| 8 | Connection Count | 1 byte | Number of connected BLE devices 0-5 | `03` (3 devices) |
| 9 | Status Flags | 1 byte | Caps/Charging/USB/BLE status bits | `18` (USB+BLE) |
| 10 | Device Role | 1 byte | `0`=Standalone, `1`=Central, `2`=Peripheral | `01` (Central) |
| 11 | Device Index | 1 byte | Split keyboard index (0=left, 1=right) | `00` |
| 12-14 | Peripheral Batteries | 3 bytes | Left/Right/Aux battery levels 0-100% | `52 00 00` (82%, none, none) |
| 15-18 | Layer Name | 4 bytes | ASCII layer identifier (optional) | `4C30...` ("L0") |
| 19-22 | Keyboard ID | 4 bytes | Hardware-unique ID (HWINFO) | `12345678` |
| 23 | Modifier Flags | 1 byte | L/R Ctrl,Shift,Alt,GUI states | `05` (LCtrl+LAlt) |
| 24 | WPM Value | 1 byte | Words per minute 0-255 | `3C` (60 WPM) |
| 25 | Channel | 1 byte | Channel number 0-255 (0=broadcast to all) | `06` (Channel 6) |

### Version Encoding (Offset 4, v2.2.0+)

```
Version byte:       [7:4] = module major (0-15)
                    [3:0] = module minor (0-15)

Profile Slot byte:  [6]   = dev flag (0=release, 1=dev)
                    [5:3] = patch version (0-7)
                    [2:0] = BLE profile slot (0-4)

Example: v2.2.0 release, profile 1
  version = 0x22, profile_slot = 0x01

Backward compatible: v2.1.0 and earlier send version=0x01 (protocol v1).
Scanner detects major=0 and displays "< v2.2".
```

### Status Flags (Offset 9)

```
Bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
    │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └─ Caps Word (1=active, 0=inactive)
    │ │ │ │ │ │ └─── Charging (1=yes, 0=no)
    │ │ │ │ │ └───── USB Connected (1=yes, 0=no)
    │ │ │ │ └─────── USB HID Ready (1=yes, 0=no)
    │ │ │ └───────── BLE Connected (1=yes, 0=no)
    │ │ └─────────── BLE Bonded (1=yes, 0=no)
    │ └───────────── Reserved (protocol version, future)
    └─────────────── Reserved (protocol version, future)
```

### Modifier Flags (Offset 23)

```
Bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
    │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └─ Left Ctrl
    │ │ │ │ │ │ └─── Left Shift
    │ │ │ │ │ └───── Left Alt
    │ │ │ │ └─────── Left GUI (Win/Cmd)
    │ │ │ └───────── Right Ctrl
    │ │ └─────────── Right Shift
    │ └───────────── Right Alt
    └─────────────── Right GUI
```

### Broadcast Intervals

The keyboard adjusts broadcast frequency based on activity to save battery:

- **Active Mode** (typing detected): 1000ms interval (1 Hz, configurable)
  - Triggered by any keypress
  - Provides periodic WPM and battery updates
  - Layer/modifier/profile changes trigger immediate burst (5×15ms)

- **Idle Mode** (no typing): 30000ms interval (configurable)
  - Activated after 5 seconds of no keypresses (configurable)
  - Battery-friendly for long idle periods
  - Layer changes still trigger burst for immediate response

## Keyboard Integration

Your ZMK keyboard needs to broadcast status via BLE Advertisement.

### Step 1: Add Module to Keyboard

Edit your keyboard's `config/west.yml`:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: prospector
      url-base: https://github.com/t-ogura

  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml

    # Add this:
    - name: prospector-zmk-module
      remote: prospector
      revision: v2.2.2
      path: modules/prospector-zmk-module
```

> **ZMK version compatibility**:
> - `v2.2.0`: Keyboard-side supports both Zephyr 4.x and 3.x. Scanner requires Zephyr 4.x.
> - `v2.0.0` / `v2.1.0`: Zephyr 3.x only

### Step 2: Enable Status Advertisement

#### Minimal Configuration (Quick Start)

Add to your keyboard's `.conf` file:

```conf
# Required: Enable status advertisement
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADVERTISEMENT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_KEYBOARD_NAME="MyKeyboard"
```

That's it! Your keyboard will broadcast status at default intervals.

#### Full Configuration (All Options)

```conf
# ===== REQUIRED =====
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADVERTISEMENT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_KEYBOARD_NAME="MyKeyboard"  # Shown on scanner (max 8 chars)

# ===== POWER OPTIMIZATION (all have sensible defaults) =====
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_ACTIVITY_BASED=y          # Default: y (enabled)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_ACTIVE_INTERVAL_MS=1000   # Default: 200 (recommended: 1000 = 1Hz)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_IDLE_INTERVAL_MS=30000    # Default: 30000 (30s when idle)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000  # Default: 5000 (5s before idle)

# ===== SPLIT KEYBOARD =====
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_FETCHING=y  # Fetch peripheral battery
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_CENTRAL_SIDE="RIGHT"        # Which side is central (LEFT/RIGHT)

# ===== PERIPHERAL BATTERY MAPPING (v2.1, for multi-peripheral setups) =====
# Use when connection order doesn't match physical layout (e.g., after settings_reset)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_HALF_PERIPHERAL=0         # Keyboard half slot (default: 0)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_AUX1_PERIPHERAL=1         # Aux1 slot - e.g., trackball (default: 1)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_AUX2_PERIPHERAL=2         # Aux2 slot - e.g., numpad (default: 2)

# ===== WPM TRACKING =====
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_WPM_WINDOW_SECONDS=30       # WPM calculation window (5-120s)

# ===== CHANNEL (v1.1.2+, optional) =====
# For multi-keyboard environments - filter by channel on scanner side
# CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_CHANNEL=0                     # 0=broadcast to all (default)
# CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_CHANNEL=1                     # 1-9=recommended (touch UI compatible)
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Keyboard Firmware

```bash
# In your keyboard config directory
west update
west build -b your_board -- -DSHIELD=your_shield

# Flash to keyboard
# (Copy .uf2 to bootloader drive)
```

### Step 4: Verify

1. Power on keyboard
2. Power on scanner
3. Scanner should detect keyboard within 1-2 seconds
4. Device name should match `CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_KEYBOARD_NAME`

## Troubleshooting

### Scanner Shows "Waiting for keyboards..."

**Problem**: Scanner not detecting keyboard.

**Solutions**:
1. Check keyboard has `CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADVERTISEMENT=y` enabled
2. Verify keyboard firmware rebuilt and flashed after adding module
3. Check keyboard is powered on and BLE is active
4. Try power cycling both devices

### Build Error: `'lv_font_montserrat_XX' undeclared`

**Problem**: LVGL font not enabled.

**Solution**: Use the default `prospector_scanner.conf` which includes all required font settings. If you're using a custom config, copy the font settings from the default file.

### Display Shows Nothing / Blank Screen

**Problem**: Display not initializing.

**Solutions**:
1. Check wiring - especially VCC/GND polarity
2. Verify backlight pin (LCD_BL → Pin 6)
3. Test with settings reset firmware
4. Check XIAO BLE has power (LED indicator)
5. Verify display module (try with non-touch firmware if you have touch display)

### Connection Shows "BLE" When USB Connected

**Problem**: USB connection not detected (should show "> USB").

**This is a known issue in v1.x** - **Fixed in v2.0**.

**Solution**: Upgrade to v2.0 firmware (both scanner and keyboard).

### APDS9960 Sensor Not Working

**Problem**: Brightness doesn't change with room lighting.

**Solutions**:
1. Check 4-pin wiring: VCC/GND/SDA (D4)/SCL (D5)
2. Verify `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=y` enabled
3. Check sensor has clear view (not blocked by case)
4. Try increasing `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ALS_MIN_BRIGHTNESS` (sensor might be too dim)

**Note**: v2.0 does NOT require interrupt pin - 4-pin connection works.

### Scanner Freezes During Use

**Problem**: Display stops updating, becomes unresponsive.

**Solution**: Upgrade to v2.2.0 or later firmware. This version uses mutex + work handler architecture with data processing separated from display rendering, preventing LVGL thread-safety issues.

### Battery Widget Not Showing

**Problem**: No battery icon in top-right corner.

**Solutions**:
1. Check LiPo battery connected to BAT+/BAT- pads
2. Verify `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BATTERY_SUPPORT=y` enabled
3. Rebuild firmware after enabling battery support

**No battery?** Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_BATTERY_SUPPORT=n` - this is expected behavior.

## Advanced Topics

### Building Custom Keyboard List

Scanner can monitor multiple keyboards simultaneously. Display automatically shows keyboards that broadcast status. No pairing needed.

### WPM Calculation Windows

Adjust WPM responsiveness:

```conf
# Ultra-responsive (10s window, 6x multiplier)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_WPM_WINDOW_SECONDS=10

# Balanced (30s window, 2x multiplier) - DEFAULT
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_WPM_WINDOW_SECONDS=30

# Stable (60s window, 1x multiplier)
# CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_WPM_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
```

Shorter window = more responsive but jumpier. Longer window = more stable but slower to reflect changes.

### Split Keyboard Central Side

For split keyboards, specify which side is central (has BLE profiles):

```conf
# In keyboard's .conf file
CONFIG_ZMK_STATUS_ADV_CENTRAL_SIDE="LEFT"  # or "RIGHT" (default)
```

This tells scanner which side to treat as "main" for connection status display.

### Debug Widget (Development)

Enable debug overlay for development:

```conf
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_DEBUG_WIDGET=y
```

Shows technical information overlaid on screen. **Disable for production** (`=n`).

## Roadmap

Future development may include Periodic Advertising (v2 protocol) for improved power efficiency. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for technical design notes.

### Original Prospector

This project builds upon the Prospector hardware platform created by carrefinho:
- **Original Project**: [prospector](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector) by carrefinho
- **Original Firmware**: [prospector-zmk-module](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector-zmk-module)
- **Hardware Design**: Seeeduino XIAO BLE + Waveshare 1.69" Round LCD with touch panel
- **3D Case Design**: Open-source STL files for 3D printing
- **License**: MIT License

**Difference**: Original Prospector uses the hardware as a dongle (keyboard connects to it), while this project uses it as an independent status monitor (keyboard stays independent). Both are valid uses of the same excellent hardware platform.
